## CSCI4448 Project 1
## Day at the Zoo  
Team: Chace Trevino, Joseph Wilson

### Assumptions
Each individual animal would have all five tasks (waking, roll call, feeding, exercise, and sleep) executed for them before moving on to the next animal. For instance, Harry the Hippo will be woken up, called for roll, fed, exercised, and put to sleep before the zookeeper moves on to Hector the Hippo.  

### Issues
There weren't really any issues with this project. Rather we just had to look up how to do a couple of things like generate random numbers and output text to a file.  

### Special Instructions  
Lines 45-46 should be uncommented in order to output the text of the zoo activities to a file.
